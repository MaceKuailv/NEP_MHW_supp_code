Run all the scripts in budget_prep/ to obtain the ECCO heat anomaly budget. 

In runs_backward/ and budget_backward/, there are scripts for generating the backward trajectories and calculating Lagrangian budget for northen and southern MHW. There initial position are defined by "all_mhw.npy". 

The notebooks can be used to reproduce the plots in the paper.
